# goSudoku sudoku solver

This package solves sudoku puzzles using brute force. It inserts numbers until
it can't insert any more without violating the rules, then starts rolling back.

## Future updates

- A more user friendly way to insert values
- Display updates
- Ability to get a hint, rather than the whole solved puzzle
